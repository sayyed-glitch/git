# Mintlify

[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) is a platform that is used to create beautiful and engaging documentation that converts users. Using MDX, you can create documentation that is powerful, well-designed, and optimized for a better user experience. It performs well, has easy navigation, and provides built-in analytical tools to help you understand how users engage with your documentation.

# Getting Started

To run the documentation site locally;

1. **Open your editor**
2. **Open the Terminal** - Typically, you can do this from a 'Terminal' tab or by using a shortcut
   (e.g., `Ctrl + ~` for Windows or `Control + ~` for Mac in VS Code).
3. Clone the [AgentGPT](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT) repository and Navigate into the docs directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT.git
cd AgentGPT
```

4.Install Mintlify on your OS

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

5. Run `mintlify install`

6. Move into the docs directory (where the `mintlify.json` file is located) and run the following command

```
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website will be available on `http://localhost:3000`

# How to create a new page

At the core of every Mintlify site is the `mintlify.json` which contains the configuration settings for the site. This file is found at the root directory of the documentation site. You can add a new page or update an existing page by editing the `mintlify.json` file.

To add a new page;

1. At the root directory, select the appropriate folder, i.e. **development**, **essentials** or **other**, and create a new file with the **.mdx** extenstion. Edit the file content.
2. Open the `mintlify.json` file.
3. Locate the navigation property. The value for the **navigation** property is an array of objects each consisting of the **group** and **pages** property. The **group** value is the name of the directory where the new page resides.
4. Update the pages' value with the file name in the form `"directory/file_name"`. For example, to create a new **todo** page under the **development** directory, enter the following;

```
   ...

   {
      "group": "Development",
      "pages": [...,"development/todo"]
   },
   ...
```

# How to update a page

To update a page in the documentation's site;

1. At the root of the **docs** directory, locate the appropriate directory i.e. where the page is located in the navigation section on the website.
2. Edit the content of the file.
3. Save the new changes to the file.
